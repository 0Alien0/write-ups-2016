**Description:**

> Description: We all love secrets. Without them, our lives would be dull. A student wrote a secure secret store, however he was babbling about problems with the database. Maybe I shouldn't use the 'admin' account. Hint1: Account deletion is intentional. Hint2: I can't handle long usernames.
