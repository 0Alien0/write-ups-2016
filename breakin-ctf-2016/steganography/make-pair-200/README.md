## Write-up

As the question suggests, if you add the rainbow (R, G, B components of the image), and you 
get a couple (even pairity), then you are good to go, else you need one more (mark it odd pairity).

If you perform a pairity check over all the elements of this image, you will end up with a 3d vector
of even and odd pairities.

Print this out as an image, mapping both in different colors. You end up with the following image
