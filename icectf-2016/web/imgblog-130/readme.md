**Category:** Web
**Points:** 130
**Description:**

I found this amazing blog about Iceland! Did I ever tell you that I love Iceland? It seems to be made from scratch by a single guy although being impressive, he doesn't seem too have much experience with web programming. Can you see if you can find any vulnerabilites to pwn his machine?
